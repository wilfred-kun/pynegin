This is where I put my ideas to implement I come up with on the go:

Contexts:
    Has position and size
    will be delegated to from gamelogic
    in gamelogic you can have multiple contexts and switch between them
    this way a menu can easily pop up, and use less rendering resources (instead
    of screen.update use screen.flip)

Animations:
    class that has some image components and loops over them
    accepts 16x16/32x32/.. files with animation tiles things

Fade for components:
    Make a component fade in/out: set alpha higher/lower over time

Make resizing possible:
    speaks for itself: resize should set isResized on the window so containers
    can update accordingly
